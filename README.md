Air::Reaver
==============

the Air::Reaver library provide an advanced and secure way for manipulate WPS data for wireless security purposes, this is one of the five libraries related to wireless security in perl and it is heavily based on Reaver.


**INSTALLATION**

is the same as every perl module

- sudo perl Makefile.PL
- sudo make
- sudo make install

but executing the first program will automatically unpack the modified Reaver library, which will install its header files under */usr/include*.
for now there are no tests, they will be added in future.


**FUNCTIONALITY**

as said before, the library will handle also other functionalities, some of the most interesting are:

- the ability of attacking the WPS  though bruteforce 
- the ability of derive WPA2 keys
- the ability of build a WPS lab


**SPECIAL THANKS**

many thanks to *andreas hadjiprocopis* for its work as co-author.
