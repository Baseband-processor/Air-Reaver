Air::Reaver
================================================

![image of wireless_security_protocols_bg](./wireless.jpg)


**WHO I AM?**

Read the Github description :)




**REQUIREMENTS**

- [x] perl 
- [x] libpcap
- [x] flex
- [x] C compiler (gcc is fine)

**INSTALLATION**

for installing the *Air::Reaver* and *ReaverWPS* programs you just need to type:

```shell
   sudo make

```

this will start the Makefile outside the C and perl directories, Reaver's Headers will be automatically installed in */usr/include*.
directory.


**C DOCUMENTATION**
 
some resources about C Reaver program are here:
  - _HACKING EXPOSEDâ„¢ WIRELESS: WIRELESS SECURITY SECRETS & SOLUTIONS SECOND AND THIRD EDITION_ 
  - https://www.willhackforsushi.com/presentations/shmoocon2007.pdf
  - https://github.com/kismetwireless/lorcon 
  - http://blog.opensecurityresearch.com/2012/09/getting-started-with-lorcon.html

but, as *Mike Kershaw* said:

*there isn't really any documentation on the other functions, sorry; the code would be the best reference there.*

so take advantage of the C open source code.

**PERL DOCUMENTATION**

if interested in more advanced examples for the perl library please go under the *examples/* directory.

the most basic usage is:



**SPECIAL THANKS**

A great thanks to *Andreas Hadjiprocopis* (aka *Bliako*), probably the best collaborator I ever had, without him the biggest part related to the C code would be broken.

**other thanks**
* perlmonks community, especially syphilis  for his initial help
* *Mike Kershaw* (aka Dragorn), the main developer of Lorcon2, who explained some obscure part of his code
* *GomoR*, the old version author, who never replied to my emails

**Future works and directions**

This library is the result of 2 months of hard work and, still now, there are several problem related to the perl-types conversion, 
Probably the project will grow even more, my main ideas are:

- [ ] offer a full coverage for the Reaver header files
- [ ] Integrate Air::Reaver with other modules, those are
   * Air::Lorcon2 -> interface to Lorcon2 library
   * Air::Pcap -> interface to airpcap library
   * Air::Crack -> interface to aircrack-ng
   * Air::KRACK -> implementation of the KRACK attack
   * Air::FakeAP -> implementation of Fluxion
   
- [ ] Write a brief PDF manual about the six perl wireless-security module

**Other suggested Perl libraries for network security**

unfortunately perl doesn't have the same number of libraries as python, but some exists!
for starting I suggest to learn:

* [Socket](https://metacpan.org/pod/Socket)
* [Net::Pcap](https://metacpan.org/pod/Net::Pcap)
* [Net::Ncap](https://metacpan.org/pod/Net::Ncap)
* [Net::Frame](https://metacpan.org/pod/Net::Frame)
* [NetPacket](https://metacpan.org/pod/NetPacket)
* [Net::Write](https://metacpan.org/pod/Net::Write)
* [Net::Analysis](https://metacpan.org/pod/Net::Analysis)
* [Net::Silk](https://metacpan.org/pod/Net::Silk)
* [Net::Inspect](https://metacpan.org/pod/Net::Inspect)
* [Net::Tshark](https://metacpan.org/pod/Net::Tshark)
* [Net::Sharktools](https://metacpan.org/pod/Net::Sharktools)
* [File::PCAP](https://metacpan.org/pod/File::PCAP)
* [Net::P0f](https://metacpan.org/pod/Net::P0f)

**PERL NETWORK SECURITY RESOURCE**

* _Automating System Administration with Perl_ (Probably one of the best books for the blue team field practices in Perl)
* _Network Programming With Perl (by Lincoln Stein, 2001)_ (even if old, still remains the best networking book for Perl developers)
* [Practical PERL for Security Practitioners](https://www.sans.org/reading-room/whitepapers/scripting/practical-perl-security-practitioners-1357)
